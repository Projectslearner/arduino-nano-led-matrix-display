# LED Matrix Display

#### Project Overview

The LED Matrix Display project demonstrates how to create and control an 8x8 LED matrix using an Arduino Nano. LED matrices are versatile displays capable of showing text, symbols, and simple animations. This project provides a basic setup for displaying patterns on the LED matrix.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **8x8 LED Matrix**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect LED Matrix to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the rows of the LED matrix to digital output pins of the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the columns of the LED matrix to digital output pins of the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper current-limiting resistors are used to prevent damage to the LEDs and Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the LED matrix to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.
   - Arrange the LED matrix to display patterns or messages.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LED matrix to see the displayed pattern.
   - Experiment with the code to create different patterns or animations on the LED matrix.

#### Applications

- **Text Display:** Use the LED matrix to display scrolling text messages or static symbols.
- **Animation:** Create simple animations or visual effects on the LED matrix.
- **Clock Display:** Show time or other information in a matrix format.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay time in the code to control the speed of pattern display or animation.
- Experiment with different patterns and designs to achieve desired visual effects.
- Ensure proper current limiting to prevent excessive current flow through the LED matrix.
